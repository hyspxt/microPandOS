# µPandOS

µPandOS is a simple, yet complete, Operative System built on three levels:
- Level 1 - Queue Manager
- Level 2 - Nucleus
- Level 3 - Support

## Compiling
- Project compiling is done by launching:
    ```sh
    make
    ```  
- To delete object file and other old stuff use:
    ```sh
    make clean
    ``` 
- To compile testers:
    ```sh
    make maketest
    ``` 
- To delete testers obj file:
    ```sh
    make cleantest
    ``` 

There is also a config example of the simulation machine (```umps3```).
