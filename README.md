# µPandOS
µPandOS is a simple, yet complete, Operative System

## Compiling

- Project compiling is done by launching:
    ```sh
    make
    ```  
- To delete object file and other old stuff use:
    ```sh
    make clean
    ``` 

There is also a config example of the simulation machine (```fin```).
